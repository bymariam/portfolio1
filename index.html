          Just kidding! <br> 
          Hi, I’m Mariam, a NYC-based Virginia native who’s always been curious about how things work—and how to make them better. <br>My journey into software engineering started in 2018, the year I graduated college and wrote my first “Hello World!” Before diving into code, I kicked off my career in sales and marketing for software companies. Working in fintech and defense contracting gave me firsthand exposure to the innovative products tshat shaped those industries. I realized my success in sales depended on deeply understanding the tools I was selling—and I couldn’t stop thinking about the *how* behind them. That curiosity inspired a major pivot: from promoting software to creating it. Now, I specialize in building sleek, user-friendly websites and apps that make people’s lives easier. Drawing on my background in sales and marketing, I approach development with a focus on user experience, business impact, and, of course, a touch of creativity. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech, rolling out another design for my brand, MISHMISHTheLabel, or taking a quick break from NYC to visit home in Virginia.
          Let's connect and build something amazing</p>
